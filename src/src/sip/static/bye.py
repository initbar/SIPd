# 4.2.4 BYE
#
# The user agent client uses BYE to indicate to the server that it
# wishes to release the call. A BYE request is forwarded like an INVITE
# request and MAY be issued by either caller or callee. A party to a
# call SHOULD issue a BYE request before releasing a call ("hanging
# up"). A party receiving a BYE request MUST cease transmitting media
# streams specifically directed at the party issuing the BYE request.
#
# If the INVITE request contained a Contact header, the callee SHOULD
# send a BYE request to that address rather than the From address.
#
# This method MUST be supported by proxy servers and SHOULD be
# supported by redirect and user agent SIP servers.

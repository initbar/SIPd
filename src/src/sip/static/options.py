# 4.2.3 OPTIONS
#
# The server is being queried as to its capabilities. A server that
# believes it can contact the user, such as a user agent where the user
# is logged in and has been recently active, MAY respond to this
# request with a capability set. A called user agent MAY return a
# status reflecting how it would have responded to an invitation, e.g.,
# 600 (Busy). Such a server SHOULD return an Allow header field
# indicating the methods that it supports. Proxy and redirect servers
# simply forward the request without indicating their capabilities.
#
# This method MUST be supported by SIP proxy, redirect and user agent
# servers, registrars and clients.
